      <h2>About <strong>The Vanishing Set</strong></h2>
      <div>
        <p><strong>The Vanishing Set</strong> is a contemporary literary espionage novel that follows a group of anti-fascist organizers who become disillusioned with the limitations of protest and mutual aid as orthodox tactics for liberation. After a demonstration against a defense contractor turns deadly, anarchists are framed for the violence, police raids escalate, and far-right groups exploit the chaos to target vulnerable communities.</p>
        <p>Ana is a community organizer who recognizes that her movement&rsquo;s visibility has become a liability. Drawing inspiration from a revolutionary folk figure, she recruits a small circle of activists into a clandestine project aimed at protecting people she will never meet while tracking the institutions and intermediaries driving the unrest. As the work deepens, Ana’s sense of self begins to erode, forcing her to confront what must be sacrificed in the pursuit of collective survival.</p>

              <h3>From a chapter titled &ldquo;Interdiscipline&rdquo;</h3>
              <h4>November 17, in Griton</h4>
            </header>
            <p class="excerpt">Ana checked her watch and reached Palace Automat with only minutes until her rendezvous time, trembling as she locked her bike, her tote bag frustratingly slipping from her shoulder and getting in her way. Only a short line inside. She grabbed an aluminum tray and started locating the items by which her contact would identify her: a large soba noodle salad, a bottle of Paix iced tea, and an oatmeal cookie. As she glanced at the time with one minute to spare, she realized that they were out of oatmeal cookies. She grabbed a chocolate chip instead and threw it label-down on her tray. She tossed cash at the checkout and grabbed a seat without a moment to spare, sweating all over in the awful cool humidity and trying to look inconspicuous. She placed the tote bag under the opposite end of the table.</p>
            <div class="full" id="outtake-1">
              <p>Almost immediately, a young misfit approached. “Excuse me,” they asked. Clearly the right person. “Have you ever tried the blistered vegetable red curry?”</p>
              <p>Close enough. “Yeah, but I recommend the eggplant muffaletta if you haven’t tried it.”</p>
              <p>The punk activist sat as Ana nodded at them. “Thanks,” they exhaled. “How are you?”</p>
              <p>“Don’t do that.” Ana tried to depressurize and had already mentally moved on to her next task. She had approximately twelve minutes. “Just act natural.”</p>
              <p>“Sorry,” the contact shrugged, looking under the table at the tote which contained two of Ana’s old moth-eaten t-shirts from which she had removed the tags and folded them neatly around a package wrapped between two small pieces of old cardboard and bound in packing tape. “This is it?” </p>
              <p>Ana closed her eyes and nodded.</p>
              <p>“So I just take this to my friend?” they asked.</p>
              <p>Ana spoke in a low tone without scanning the packed cafeteria. “If someone had followed me here, you’d be done for. You know the plan, right? Just nod.”</p>
              <p>The courier nodded, and behind them, Ana saw Regina enter, eight minutes early. </p>
              <p>“Alright good, just go,” she said in an attempt to scuttle them off.</p>
              <p>“Okay, okay,” the contact replied. “This is so cool.”</p>
              <p>“Hey,” Ana called them back. “No, this is serious. Treat it that way.”</p>
              <p>She watched the courier carry the tote out of the automat, and hoped the club had not just made a dire mistake. She had lost her appetite.</p>

              <h3>From a chapter titled &ldquo;Safety&rdquo;</h3>
              <h4>July 10, in Dragones</h4>
            </header>
            <p class="excerpt">Callie drove a rented electric vehicle down king palm-lined Dragones boulevards in lustrous sunshine, listening to directions, scanning the sidewalks and shops. She pulled into a parking spot in South Greenhall, one of the city’s few walkable neighborhoods, and checked her original itinerary: two record stores, five vintage shops, three clubs, eleven bars, a park, and an art gallery.</p>
            <div class="full" id="outtake-2">
              <p>When she exited the car, her heart began to palpitate, a physiological reaction that puzzled her. She had sourced most of her agenda from the social media of an old paramour, and the chance she might run into him was too much for her to handle. She knew she would sleep with him whether or not he had a girlfriend. She tried to ignore it, focusing instead on pinpointing the greatest intelligence value from her list. She squinted behind her sunglasses, trying to breathe slowly without thinking about her shaking hands and chest. </p>
              <p>At a record shop called Public Pool, she spied a few corners of a well-designed protest poster that had been sloppily shredded off the glass. She could make out the words “Dragones in revolt” and the date, “April 2,” attempting to entice the ghosts who no longer walked by. She posed to pretend to take a photo of her own reflection.</p>
              <p>She looked inside at the bulletin board and leafed through the zines in the rack stuffed between mass market publications. She sized up the man behind the counter, wondering how much she could trust someone like him. Measuring the possibilities of what to ask him without sounding suspicious sent her into a spin. He busied himself on his device as an old Tone Decimaters album played too loudly for a conversation she would prefer to keep casual. She glanced around at the sparse crowd. It was a bust.</p>
              <p>Every subsequent stop proved more of the same. The affluent, dispersed, image-conscious community gave her culture shock, but she still managed to find new shops, cafés, and bars to return to later at night with Topsy when they might encounter more action. She glanced down side corridors and found remnants of primitive anarchist graffiti covered by more cultivated street art. On lampposts she found scratched and partially covered stickers promising revolution, women’s rights, gay rights, trans rights, racial justice, and liberation in all forms. Sun-fried flyers for protests and long-unrealized strikes, their details barely perceptible. Every remnant of a resistance culture led her down paths so blank she felt like an archaeologist trying to make sense of an extinct civilization. The lack of any oppressive far-right force felt almost more ominous than the lack of an organized left. She sensed only the people and the state. </p>
              <p>Black smoke poured off of a fire on a distant hill as she visited a new neighborhood for lunch, empty save for a pair of older women. The proprietor had been involved in a few migrants and food security causes as a public advocate and fundraiser. Callie waited until a lull to make her move. </p>
              <p>She played up her Alexis Miller persona, just as Ana taught her, and eased into it by claiming to have seen him speak at a tenants’ rights rally a few months back. He seemed perplexed by the out-of-context question and Callie worried Seth gotten bad intelligence. When he finally got on board, he downplayed both his role and the efficacy of the left.</p>
              <p>Callie had dressed down for the trip, eschewing her high-feminine wardrobe in exchange for a loose vintage black tank top layered over a black swimsuit and faded black denim shorts. He started flirting and her instincts told her to use it, but it made no sense on a pessimist like him.</p>
              <p>She took a chance and said she had been an organizer with Tremor City Anarchists to see if that would tempt him to discuss their fate, but the man did not seem to be hip to the young left. Out of desperation, she asked him if he knew of anyone who would want to hurt the organization. At that, he lost his patience with her prodding and called her a “kid.” Red-faced, Callie apologized and shook her nerves with a walk around the neighborhood, lost amongst the taco trucks, galleries, coffeeshops, yoga studios, and burger shops. She had a few hours to kill before meeting Topsy. </p>
              <p>In a park, people gathered for a small festival. Callie found a table for a local migrants’ rights group she had never heard of. She often had a difficult time reading the difference between non-profit organizations and grassroots groups when they were put together well. She made small talk with the college student behind the table, who talked to her about the crisis. Misaria had slipped further into the sea, their provisional government washed away with the tides, and the Allied Treaty Organization had stepped in. The organization seemed only interested in collecting debited donations, so Callie wound the conversation down. </p>
              <p>At the “punk” beach called Gang of Nines, she found that the nihilistic Dragones surfers and skaters expressed their rebellion through disengagement, fighting, and drugs. She felt cramped without her art collective behind her, and could not understand the secret vernacular that would have lead her to the right people.</p>
              <p>At her rental she swapped back to her Callie persona by letting her hair down and changing into a starchy shirtdress. </p>
              <p>“Where are we having dinner?” she asked Topsy when she came to pick her up.</p>
              <p>“I’ve got us a table somewhere tony,” Topsy replied as they traversed the city past short structures with atomic angles, sloping roofs, and dry stucco. </p>
              <p>They arrived at a roofdeck sushi joint and were seated by a window overlooking the pool at the Vanderstone Hotel. Neon signs flickered on as the sun set to reveal glowing wildfire lines climbing across the mountains beyond the city like some sort of permanent, hellish new ecosystem. “The pink was darling but I missed this color on you,” said Topsy.</p>
              <p>Callie thanked her and swept her hair over her shoulders.</p>
              <p>“You planning on seeing the old boy while you’re here?” Topsy asked.</p>
              <p>“Of course not.”</p>
              <p>Topsy tilted her head. “You sure? Thought he was the tops, the primo inamorato.”</p>
              <p>“No, I don’t think so,” Callie said, and sighed.</p>
              <p>“Is that what’s bothering you?”</p>
              <p>Callie straightened up and smiled at her. “I’m okay, I apologize. I’m here with you now. What are we thinking?”</p>
              <p>“I will be having a tuna steak,” said Topsy as she clapped her menu shut. </p>
              <p>Callie scanned her options but her failures distracted her. Ana had messaged the club on Zanthem with news that she had been in touch with Codey and had gained access to one of his communities on Meetbox, a free-speech absolutist platform favored by the far-right. Callie trusted Zanthem almost less than she did Meetbox, but it was what they had. Ana’s success compounded Callie’s melancholy. “Kyabetsu to moyashi.”</p>
              <p>“Come on now, little maskowl,” said Topsy. </p>
              <p>Codey’s group had pre-planned the infiltration. Callie could understand his lie, but rolled him over in her mind. “He could be right down there.” Callie nodded down at the Vanderstone’s pool. </p> 
              <p>“Not used to seeing you rattled,” said Topsy.</p>
              <p>She refused to underestimate their adversaries, even those as dull as Stone. Fascism may suggest a weakness of mind based in fear and anger, but she had known plenty of cunning and rich men who shared their beliefs. “Part of it is excitement, considering the fantasy of some affair.”</p>
              <p>“I know you see plenty of action back home.”</p>
              <p>Ana had described how a dozen or so different personalities in the Meetbox channel goaded one another into carrying out the operation, but that there was one clear architect whose identity remained shrouded. “Yes, but they can all be idiots I’m afraid.” </p>
